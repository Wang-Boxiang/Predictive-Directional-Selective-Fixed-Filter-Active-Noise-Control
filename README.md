# Predictive-Directional-Selective-Fixed-Filter-Active-Noise-Control

This repository provides the open-source code for our paper:
"Predictive Directional Selective Fixed-Filter Active Noise Control for Moving Sources Using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network" (ICASSP 2026 submission).

The code will be released once the paper results are available.
Thank you for your interest!
