# Predictive Directional SFANC for Moving Sources
This repository will host the official open-source code of our work:
**Predictive Directional Selective Fixed-Filter Active Noise Control for Moving Sources Using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network** *(submitted to ICASSP 2026)*.

The code, together with accompanying scripts and documentation, will be released after the paperâ€™s review process is completed.
We sincerely thank you for your interest and invite you to revisit this repository for future updates.
